# WinBoyEmulator
This is my attemption to create Game Boy emulator. After this is somewhat complete, I'll start to port it to Android. 
I'll use C# because it is easy to use (for me) and quite simple language (compared to C/C++ for example).

I want to do this project, because I think this would be fun! :)

At the moment my main focus is study Game Boy and it's emulation.
